## Project Ideas
This hackathon will focus on two main types of contributions:
- Framework Updates: These updates are relatively easier to ramp up and should be completed within a few days. We will provide a list of TODOs to guide these tasks, such as adding new utility functions, improving documentation, optimizing current components, or refactoring code for better modularity and scalability. These tasks are great for quickly contributing to PyHealth and getting familiar with the codebase.
- Research Paper Implementation: This option allows you to implement a new research paper, either your own or from our prepared list. It may involve adding new datasets, task definitions, models, or evaluation techniques. Research paper implementations are more complex and may take longer, but they provide a better opportunity to demonstrate your coding capabilities.
  - Breaking the Paper into Small PRs: If you choose to work on a research paper, we recommend breaking it into multiple small PRs and working on them step-by-step. This approach allows for easier review and feedback, and helps manage the complexity by focusing on incremental progress.
